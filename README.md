## Cocktail-Companion

# The Cocktail DB Api:
For endpoints/instructions go here: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
If you want to work on this for the legacy project, my key is 9973533. Replace v1/1 with v2/9973533

# Dependencies
Run npm i in main repo Cocktail Companion, then run npm i in ./client and ./server
(used axions in myApi because fetch simply did not work)

# There are comments in the code to help explain what some of the stuff is meant to do
